# DBCycle

The game:  
Getting to Dev BootCamp (DBC) on a bicycle is hard! Dodge buses, cars, and potholes and pick up coffee for a boost while you make your way to school.

During my time at Dev Bootcamp, we were asked to develop projects we were passionate about. I decided to take on developing a video game manipulating DOM objects with JavaScript and jQuery. My goal was to improve my JS skills, and boy, did I. The code is not clean, nor is it perfect, but the game is playable and fun to view!
